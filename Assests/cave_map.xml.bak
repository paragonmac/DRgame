  <description>With a deafening crash, the cave entrance collapses behind you, sealing your fate.
You find yourself in a dim chamber, remnants of stonework lying in rubble. The damp, earthy
smell fills your nostrils as faint light cracks from above. Evidence of goblin activity is
everywhere: crude tools, scattered bones, makeshift shelters. Scratches on walls and fire
remnants tell of bustling goblin life, now mysteriously absent. Chilling silence, broken only by
distant dripping. Your eye catches faint tracks leading east, through a passage escaping the
cave-in. The unknown awaits; you're not the first here, nor likely the last. The depths beckon,
with no way back.</description>
